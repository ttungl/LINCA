function [ pr] = findCycle( A,ee,isU )
% Find the cycle path due to adding an entering arc "ee" into T.
% If one add an arc to a tree, there arise the unique circuit.
% this function "cy" compurtes this unique circuit for the input data:
% A : adjacency matrix of the graph obtained from the tree by adding new arc
% between two vertices in the tree with an infinite cost.
% i,j : two specified vertices in the tree
