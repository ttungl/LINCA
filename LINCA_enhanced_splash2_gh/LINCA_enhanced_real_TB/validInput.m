function [ isValid ] = validInput( A,D,G )
% This function provides the inputting validation of the adjacency matrixA, 
% the demand vector D and the arc cost matrix G.
% A and G must be two full square matrix. 
% The number of rows/columns of A or G is equal to the number of nodes of D.
% Sum of the D(i) for all vertices 1,бн,N must be 0.

%INPUT:
% "A" is an N by N matrix whose entries A(i,j) denote the capacities of the arc ij. Assume A(i,j) are nonnegative integers. 
% "D" is a N-dimensional vector whose integer entries D(i) denote the demand function of the vertex i: if d(i)>0 vertex i is called a demand vertex and if d(i)<0, it is called a supply vertex. 
% "G" is an N by N matrix whose entries G(i,j) denote the costs of the arc ij. Assume g(i,j) are nonnegative.

%INPUT:
% "isValid", a boolean variable
