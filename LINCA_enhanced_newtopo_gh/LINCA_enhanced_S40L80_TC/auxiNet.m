function [ b, c, M, f, pi] = auxiNet( A,G,D )
%   Set up an auxilliary network by adding a new node into the original network, 
%   Label this new node "n+1" as special. For every other node i,
%       if i is a supply node, draw an arc from i to *, unless such an arc already exists
%       if i is a demand node, draw an arc from * to i, unless such an arc already exists
%       Define costs for every new arc is larger than the largest one of the costs of all original arcs.

%   The auxilliary network has an obvious feasible tree solution
%   that can be used to initiate the network simplex algorithm.

% INPUT:
% The adjacency matrix "A", the demand vector "D" and the arc cost matrix "G", of the original network.

% OUTPUT:
% The adjacency matrix "b" and the arc cost matrix "c", of the auxilliary network.
% M is the largest cost of all arcs in the auxilliary network.
% f, an obvious feasible tree solution of the auxilliary network. 
% pi, Simplex multiplier
